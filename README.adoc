= expenses-server

This is *not* an Android project, nor is it a traditional Java Enterprise service.
Spring Boot provides the ability to build tiny services like this, thanks to
the Apache Tomcat project's "embeddable Tomcat". 

This style of project would be quite suitable for use as a MicroService, given
other infrastructure around it.

To start it, you should only need to invoke the 'runserver' script.
