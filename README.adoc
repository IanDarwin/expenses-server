= expenses-server

This is *not* an Android project, nor is it a traditional Java Enterprise service.
Spring Boot provides the ability to build tiny services like this, thanks to
the Apache Tomcat project's "embeddable Tomcat".

The server uses https on port 8443 with a self-signed certificate, since
modern Android requires https even on 10.0.2.2.

When the server is running, you can visit https://localhost:8443/expenses to see the data.

To pre-seed some data (so you can view it in a web browser before you get
the Expenses app working, say) you can run scripts/pre-seed-data.

This style of project would be quite suitable for use as a MicroService, given
other infrastructure around it.

To start it, you should only need to invoke the 'runserver' script.
